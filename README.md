## About

MINTSTRIDE is a philanthropy-first dental initiative built to create community, deliver education, and expand access to oral health. We focus on preventive care, education, and reaching underserved communities through direct outreach and engagement.

## The Problem

50% of children in the U.S. experience tooth decay by age 8. Dental cavities are the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood. Tooth decay is strongly linked to education, access, and socioeconomic status—but this issue is preventable.

## What We Do

We believe that early dental care changes everything. MINTSTRIDE addresses the gap through:

- **Dental supply distribution** — Getting oral care supplies to underserved communities
- **Preventive education** — Modern, engaging content that teaches healthy habits
- **Community building** — Connecting dental students and professionals
- **Sustainable growth** — Growing from campus organization to established practice
